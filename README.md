# QWICX-Week2

A small static web project for Week 2 and 3 exercises. Includes a simple landing page and a form example to demonstrate basic HTML and CSS.

## Files
- [index.html](index.html): Landing page / navigation.
- [form.html](form.html): Example form demonstrating inputs and submission behavior.
- [style.css](style.css): Styles used by the pages.
- [README.md](README.md): This file.

## Usage
- Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser (double-click or use a local server).
- Open [form.html](form.html) to view and test the form UI.
- There is no backend—submitting the form will use the browser's default behavior unless you add JavaScript.
